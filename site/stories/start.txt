.. admonition:: What should be here

   This is your landing page. So this page is the most important one!
   You don't want it to be very long. If you could fit the important
   bits in one screen it's best!
   
   At least it should:
   
   * Describe the event (1 or 2 paragraphs)
   * Say when and where (linked to `location <location>`_ for details) 
   * Show your main sponsors if you have them
   * Mention if the event costs money
   * Mention any big names you have speaking
   * Invite people to signup for the event (if needed)
   * Show a news feed. I suggest a twitter widget!

What is The Little Python Meeting?
----------------------------------
   
The Little Python Meeting is a one-day event meant to lure people new to
programming into worshipping significant whitespace and contemplation of
the self. There will be workshops, games and raffles! Cotton candy!

Some of our speakers will knock your socks off. And others will put your socks
back on, because in the Python community we are *that* nice. No previous Python
experience required, there is a beginner's track, a serious track and a "I can't
believe it's not Guido" track for those of a hardcore inclination.

The event is free of charge, and we'll give away free t-shirts we got from
the salvtion army, because if we actually had money we would be using a real 
website and not `nikola-event-kit <https://github.com/ralsina/nikola-event-kit>`_.

If you want to come, please `signup </signup/>`_ so we put aside one shirt for you.

When and Where?
---------------

At the Royal Albert Hall, in London, January 32nd 2022 [`more details </location/>`_]
